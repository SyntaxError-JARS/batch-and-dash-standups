We started talking about the progress in our projects but most of us didn't have time to work on it yesterday due to being busy working on the React mini project. 
We were happy about how powerful React is and how fun to have some experience with it .
Unfortunately, some of us couldn't launch our React properly as we wanted, however we are encouraged to work on it more later on today maybe be able to fix the
bugs and have our first React project launched as expected.

Stand up  for Bash and Dash group: 05/20/2022

 we started by talking about the project1 that should meet the mvp and much more than what is requiered,
 two week is short time so we should work on it daily and trying to implement everything we were provided.
 furthermore, we start create our repositories on monday and go through the requiement and see how much readying we need to do. 
As far as JS, we should keep up learining so what we will be provided to be able to implement it in our project, also we made sure to 
manage our time properly because we have a lot to do.
 Also we should practice on documentations useing technical terms and learn how to use it in our projects
 and also within our stand up. in this phase we are feeling to we are changing to professional devloper 
so we need to catch up and project one is our base for standing out and using what we have learened, 
some of our member still trying to have better understanding about project0 to use the knowledage over there in our project1.
